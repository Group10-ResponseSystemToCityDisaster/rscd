# Project Description
This system involves citizens of Dublin City reporting a disaster at any location in the city. By reporting the disaster to the Emergency Response Team, the Emergency Response Team can then take corresponding measures to address the disaster in a timely manner.

# Project Structure
The project is divided into two parts: the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is developed using React, and the back-end is developed using Django. The front-end and back-end are connected through RESTful APIs.

# How to run the project
